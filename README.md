# Pizza-Hut-Sales-Analysis

 ### Project overview
 The objective of this project is to analyze Pizza Hut sales data using SQL to extract insights regarding customer ordering behavior, revenue generation, and pizza preferences. By performing various SQL queries, I have developed a deeper understanding of data analysis techniques and how to apply them to real-world scenarios.

 ### Data Sources
 1. pizzas.csv
 2. pizza_types.csv
 3. orders.csv
 4. Order_details.csv

 ### Tools
 - Excel - Data Cleaning
 - SQL Server - Data Analysis

 ### Data Cleaning
 In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
 1. Data loading and Inspection
 2. Handling missing values
 3. Data Cleaning and Formatting

 ### Exploratory Data Analysis
 Pizza hut sales involved exploring the sales data to answer the key questions such as:
 1. Find the total number of orders placed.
 2. Calculate the total revenue from pizza sales.
 3. Identify the highest-priced pizza.
 4. Determine the most frequently ordered pizza size.
 5. List the top 5 pizzas by order quantity.
 6. Calculate the total quantity ordered for each pizza category.
 7. Analyze the distribution of orders by hour of day.
 8. Determine the order distribution of pizzas by category.
 9. Calculate the average number of pizzas ordered each day.
 10. Identify the top 3 pizzas based on revenue.
 11. Calculate each pizza typeâ€™s percentage contribution to total revenue.
 12. Track cumulative revenue growth over time.
 13. Determine the top 3 pizzas by revenue within each category.

 ### Recommendations
 Based on our comprehensive analysis and insights, here are the conclusions drawn and future recommendations aimed at enhancing the success of the pizza company 
 - Consider promoting more diverse pizza options within the Chicken and Veggie categories to stimulate sales. 
 - In classic pizza category increases the offers and discounts to pizzas other than classic deluxe pizza to remove the of revenue difference between classic deluxe pizza and others. 
 - we can recommend by creating new types of pizzas in chicken category as it is most popular so the customers will have more options to choose from the menu. By this the revenue increases greatly. 
 - Implement targeted marketing strategies to increase awareness and demand for XL and XXL pizza sizes. 
 - Adjust operational hours to align with customer preferences, potentially extending availability during peak demand hours and scaling back during slower periods like early mornings and late nights.
